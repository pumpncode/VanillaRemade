# Vanilla Remade - Balatro Mod

Remakes vanilla objects using SMODS and simple hooks. (Still WIP)

This is not meant to be a tutorial or explained example mod like [these ones](https://github.com/Steamodded/examples/) nor is it meant to be used for playing but rather as a reference point for your own mod effects.

Please make sure to check the [SMODS documentation](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) as well for more information and guides.

As much of the code is inspired by Balatro's own code, this repository doesn't include a license.
